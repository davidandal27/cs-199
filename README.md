## Pretrained Model
We have uploaded pretrained models of our experiments. You can download pretrained models from [OneDrive](https://entuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/truongdu001_e_ntu_edu_sg/EaBasBsecRpErWEVzXdht7cBiWWYFuLTeXt11ABbHX9yBg?e=vxVOOI). 

## Setting up environment
```
conda create --name asvspoof5 python=3.9
conda activate asvspoof5
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Before running the experiment, replace the data directory of `database_path` in the config file of `./config/AASIST_ASVspoof5.conf`.

To train & evaluate the model:
```
python ./main.py --config ./config/WavLM_Nes2Net_ASVspoof5.conf
```
### Acknowledge
Our work is built upon the [Baseline-AASIST](https://github.com/asvspoof-challenge/asvspoof5/tree/main/Baseline-AASIST) We also follow some parts of the following codebases:

[HM-Conformer](https://github.com/talkingnow/HM-Conformer/tree/main) (for noise augmentation).

[unilm](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm) (for WavLM model).
